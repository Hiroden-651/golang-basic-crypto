# Vigenere Cipher

This cipher is similar to the Caesar Cipher except that instead of shifting all letters by a single value, the number of shifts per letter are determined by a specified key. This key is used for both encrypting and decrypting a plaintext message.

For example, let's say we want to encrypt the plaintext message ```bash
HELLOWORLD
```
